### Instructions
- install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- download this repo (docker-compose) and make sure it's in the same root DIR as the Frontend + Backend GIT repos, i.e. so you have all 3 repos at the same level
- run 'docker compose up' to start (you can now edit your code live on your Local repos & this will be reflected in the Docker Container)
- run 'docker compose down' to stop
