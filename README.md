### Instructions

- Install Docker Desktop: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- Clone/download this `docker-compose` repo, and ensure it's placed in the same root directory as your **Frontend** and **Backend** repos â€” so all three repos are at the same folder level.
- Start the containers:
  ```bash
  docker compose up
  ```
  You can now edit your code locally in your Frontend/Backend repos and see the changes reflected live inside the Docker container.

- Stop the containers:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
